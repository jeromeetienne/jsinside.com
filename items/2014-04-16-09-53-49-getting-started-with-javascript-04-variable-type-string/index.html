<p>This course will teach you how to store text. In programming text is usually called &quot;string&quot;, you will see why in the video. You will understand why strings don&#39;t react the same way as numbers. We will do some more additions, but this time with strings of text! You will discover that it is possible to add two texts together with practical examples. We will also do more advanced operations to modify strings that have nothing to do with normal mathematics.</p>
