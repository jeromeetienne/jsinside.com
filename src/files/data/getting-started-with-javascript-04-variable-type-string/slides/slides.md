# Variable Type String

### What is the type String?

In human terms

> **"Type string is to store text."**

Suprising, isn't it ? :)

--

## Then, why not call that "the type *text*" instead ?

--

### Funny Historical Reason

* In the past, computer stored text as **string of character**.
* With time, it got shorten to **string**.
* So now a text is called a string.

Isn't history funny ? :P

--

## What can we do with strings then ?

--

### Adding Strings

* Adding strings is just putting one at the end of the other.
* They don't react the same way as ```Number``` 

```
var value = "he"+"llo"; // value is equal to "hello"
```

Still cool, no ?

--

## Are all the operations are possible on string too ?

--

### More advanced operations on strings

* ```+``` is the only math operator for string.
* But it is possible to play with it.


```
var value = "hello".length;        // value is equal to 5 because "hello" has 5 characters
var value = "hello".toUpperCase(); // value is "HELLO"
var value = "JOHn".toLowerCase();  // value is "john"
```

## Let's pack it up.

### What Have We Learned ?

* The type ```String``` can store text of any length.
* It is called string for funny historical reason.
* How to add strings together with ```+```
* How to modify string in more advanced ways.

Not bad. Let's pat our back :)
