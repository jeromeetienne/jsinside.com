The goal is to do short educational videos where you will learn useful things to improve your technical skills.
With JSinside you will improve your knowledge as a web dev in only a few minutes.
You don't need to prepare for hours or spend your day reading boring lectures to learn something new.
All videos will be less than 4 minutes long.
There wont be any blablabla, our courses will be direct and to the point.
Thus, the no bullshit approach :) 

Another main advantage is that you can learn anything from basic language programming to 
cutting edge innovations and writing better code. 
You can also learn how to do cool demos on 3D and enjoy creating your own video games on the web.

We know it can be hard at first when you start learning a new topic that you don't
understand or don't know anything about, that is why we will take you step by step
through the process. Lessons will include a number of short videos that make up the
subject, each video will be precise and efficient. 

The high quality of our videos is assured since you will learn from a professional
with a long time experience on the field. In our videos you will learn from useful
information from practical examples.
You will be given tips and key advice on how to increase your skills.
Our videos will be up to date to keep you up to speed informed when it comes to new technologies. 

The order of lessons wont be imposed. Honestly, we hope that you learn from all the
videos because we have truly enjoyed making them for you, but actually you can start
anywhere and stop anywhere you want, choosing only the topics that interest you the most.
You can take your time to learn, go at your own rhythm and pace. 
The most important thing to keep in mind is that coding will be done and explained in
bite sized and easy to understand way.
