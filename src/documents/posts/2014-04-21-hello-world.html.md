Hello everybody! We have just created our JSinside website. We are quite proud of it.
It is a professional training site with everything you need to learn about coding software in JavaScript.
We have decided to release it as a rudimentary version because we're depending on your feedback.
We want you, dear users, to help us figure it out along the way.   

We hope you enjoy it.
