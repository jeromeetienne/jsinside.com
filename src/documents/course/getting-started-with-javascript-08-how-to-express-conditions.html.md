In this last "Getting started with Javascript" course you will learn how to express a condition by comparing values. You will understand that operators have various ways to express conditions. Operators compare values to determine the equality or difference between them, and conditions assign value to a variable. It is important to keep in mind that conditions can either be true or false, this is because conditions are boolean. You will learn how to chain conditions together. You will also find out that there are more complex/subtle ways to express and group conditions in your code.
