In this video you will learn how to store values called numbers. We will do a little bit of Math, by adding, subtracting and doing other basic operations with these numbers. But since we're not in school any more, we will also learn how to do more advanced operations with Math API. This course will show you that it is easy to group operations together and that math can also be useful when coding.
