This course is all about how better.js can improve your [classes](http://betterjs.org/docs/betterjs-class.html). We will continue with the study of private and we will see how it works with and without better.js. This comparison will show us the advantages of a well verified code. We will understand how better.js detects wrong type for arguments and for properties, thus helping you detect the incongruities in your code. There are a lot of practical examples along the way that you can try on your own project.
