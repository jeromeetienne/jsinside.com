Everything in this world depends on a condition. It's the same thing in Javascript. In this course you will learn to define when something happens or not, depending on a given condition. This video will explain all about the "if" and the "else" conditions, the important difference between them and how to include them in your code. You will find out what branching is, and you will also learn how to chain conditions in your code the way you want.
